code for labs from fundamentals of programming
All code written by David Mackay (me) will be found in lab.py files.

Labs 9 and 10 might be particularly interesting, they create a tower defense game. Other labs involve graph traversal and sorting arrays I think.

This is a class for fudamentals of programming so, it's the fundamentals of programming!
